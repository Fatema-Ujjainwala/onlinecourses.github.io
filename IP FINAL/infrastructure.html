			<h3>What is Infrastructure Security?</h3>
	<p> <b>Infrastructure security</b> is the security provided to protect infrastructure, especially critical infrastructure, such as airports, highways rail transport, hospitals, bridges, transport hubs, network communications, media, the electricity grid, dams, power plants, seaports, oil refineries, and water systems. Infrastructure security seeks to limit vulnerability of these structures and systems to sabotage, terrorism, and contamination.
Critical infrastructures naturally utilize information technology as this capability has become more and more available. As a result, they have become highly interconnected, and interdependent. Intrusions and disruptions in one infrastructure might provoke unexpected failures to others. How to handle interdependencies becomes an important problem.</p>

				<summary>	Semester 3 : Computational number theory and Crptogrqaphy<br></summary>
					<h3>What is Computational number theory and Cryptography? </h3>		<br>
					<p><b>Computational number theory</b> is the branch of number theory concerned with finding and implementing efficient computer algorithms for solving various problems in number theory. Much progress has been made in this field in recent years, both in terms of improved computer speed and in terms of finding more efficient algorithms. Two important applications of computational number theory are primality testing and prime factorization of large integers.<br>
					In computer science, <b>Cryptography</b> refers to secure information and communication techniques derived from mathematical concepts and a set of rule-based calculations called algorithms to transform messages in ways that are hard to decipher. These deterministic algorithms are used for cryptographic key generation and digital signing and verification to protect data privacy, web browsing on the internet and confidential communications such as credit card transactions and email. </p>

						<b>Network security</b> is any activity designed to protect the usability and integrity of your network and data. It includes both hardware and software technologies. Effective network security manages access to the network. It targets a variety of threats and stops them from entering or spreading on your network.</p>

				<summary>	Semester 5 : Ethical Hacking<br>	</summary>
					<h3>What is Ethical Hacking? </h3>		<br>
					<p><b>Ethical Hacking</b> sometimes called as Penetration Testing is an act of intruding/penetrating into system or networks to find out threats, vulnerabilities in those systems which a malicious attacker may find and exploit causing loss of data, financial loss or other major damages.  The purpose of ethical hacking is to improve the security of the network or systems by fixing the vulnerabilities found during testing. Ethical hackers may use the same methods and tools used by the malicious hackers but with the permission of the authorized person for the purpose of improving the security and defending the systems from attacks by malicious users.</p>
